# Function is a block of code which is used to perform some specific task when it is called.

# Syntax:
# def function_name():
#   Statements

# Parts of Function:
# 1) Function Declaration
# 2) Function Definition
# 3) Function Call

# Function Declaration & Definition
# Function name is commonly declared using camelCase
def sayHello():
    print("Hello Students!")

# Function Call
sayHello()
sayHello()
sayHello()

# Function with Parameters
# fName is a parameter
def greet(fName):
    print(f"Good Morning, {fName}")

# Akshay is a argument and also Regular Argument
greet("Akshay")
greet("Ajay")

def sum(a, b):
    print(f"Sum of {a} and {b}: {a+b}")

sum(10, 20)

# Paramters and Arguments:
# Variables within a paranthesis while defining a function is called as Parameter

# Variables within a paranthesis while calling a function is called as Argument

# functions with Default Parameter
def myInternship(company="ParvaM"):
    print(f"I'm doing my Internship at {company}")

myInternship()
myInternship("VTU")

# Function with Return Value
def square(number):
    return number**2

squareOf5 = square(5)
print(f"Square of 5: {squareOf5}")

# Two types of Functions: 
# Arbitrary Arguments (*args)
# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (**kwargs)

# *args - If you don't know the number of arguments which may be given by user, in that time  we will use Arbitrary Arguments

# We don't know the limit of registration, so we can use *args
def internshipRegistration(*args):
    print("Completed Students List: ", args)

internshipRegistration("Akshay", "Ajay", "Akash", "Vikas", "Tejas")

internshipRegistration()

# Sum of the given variable number of arguments
def sumOfNumbers(*numbers):
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        sum += num
    return sum

print("Sum: ", sumOfNumbers())
print("Sum of 2 Numbers: ", sumOfNumbers(2, 3))
print("Sum of 5 Numbers: ", sumOfNumbers(5, 10, 15, 20, 25))
print("Sum of 8 Numbers: ", sumOfNumbers(3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 19))

# Combining Regular Argument with Arbitrary Argument

# domain is normal parameter, *students can accept any number of arguments

# Python & Java are Regular Arguments, Students Names are arbitrary arguments

# Arbitrary Keyword Arguments - **kwargs

    print("My Last name is", person["lName"])

# It is same as that of *args, but we need to give the keyword for each arguments
